# Access the registry examples

This sample takes a client_id and secret and adds an entry in the registry depending if the client_id/secret combination is a user or an organization api key.
- ** user ** : Add an entry in a user registry using client credentials
- ** organization ** : Add an entry in an organization registry using client credentials

After this, an anonymous client is created and the registry entry created in the previous step is requested and printed.
